# Project Description
The IO Rocket was a ~ 1.8 meters rocket made by members of the [https://epflrocketteam.ch/our-projects/io/](EPFL Rocket Team - ERT).

It wasn't designed for competition purposed but rather to let us learn new skills as many of us building the rocket were in their first or second year of bachelor.

I've personnaly worked under the avionic sub-system, more precisely I was tasked to build to PCBs responsible for telemetry and triggering the second explosive charge (to deploy the second chute).

It was for me the opportunity to learn the software Altium Designer, a schematic and PCB design software

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IO project was ended sooner than expected and we never had the opportunity to rebuild a second enhanced version.

In fact, the only IO rocket we've launched was really rough, see below ;)

# Some insights of the avionic
Components:
- IMU : attitude
- BMP180 : pressure, altitude, temperature
- Arduino nano : MCU
- Lora : Radio
